            <p class="albump">Words can't describe this album. It's a masterpiece, you need to listen to it yourself.
                Rap, but also gender-bending, complex yet touching, it talks about issues that are still relevant in our
                society, like police brutality, racism, and even some of Kendrick's personal life stories. It's not a
                coincidence that the album is 5th on Metacritic's best albums of all time list.</p>

            <p class="albump">One half of the soundtrack of my early teens. This album embodies everything an angsty
                teen feels, from wanting to riot against everyone and everything, to sadness, hopefulness and just
                feeling powerful. Doesn't hit as hard nowadays, but the nostalgia always does. Regarded as one of the
                best rock albums of all time, mostly by me.</p>

            <p class="albump">My favourite metal album from my favourite metal band. Covers similar subjects to every
                album of the genre. It is also the other half of the soundtrack to my teens. Even if it's not your cup
                of tea, hopefully it'll introduce you to their more recent work, which might be more friendly.</p>

            <p class="albump">Is my adoration for Kendrick Lamar obvious yet? Just like TPAB, this album touches present
                day society's issues, but in a more personal way, as it is more of an album where Kendrick talks about
                his own
                personal teenage and adult stories to display how he views the system.</p>

            <p class="albump">Widely regarded as being in the top 5 of the best rap albums of all-time. In my opinion
                it's not as much about what he says, but about the experience of listening to the album. It came at a
                troubled time in Kanye's life, which is translated into the sound of this album. Graphic yet full of
                emotions.</p>

            <p class="albump">Portuguese rapper Papillon's debut album. What hooked me to this album was the honesty in
                every song; from more upbeat tracks like Iminente (Imminent), to the sorrowful Imagina (Imagine),
                Papillon talks about his troubled life as well as his most happiest moments, which are incredibly
                relatable. Worth a listen if you don't mind translating the lyrics.</p>
